        <p id="p1">The justify value for the text-align property in CSS is used to justify the text within a container. When you set text-align: justify;, it adjusts the spacing between words in a way that the lines of text fill the entire width of the container, creating a neat and aligned appearance.</p>

        <p id="p2">This is different from text-align: left;, where the text is aligned to the left, and the right side may have uneven spacing. With text-align: justify;, the browser automatically adjusts the space between words to ensure that both the left and right edges are straight.</p>

        <p id="p3">It's worth noting that the last line in a paragraph might not be fully justified if it's the last line in the container, as there is no need to adjust spacing to reach the right edge.</p>
